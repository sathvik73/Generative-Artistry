Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Python and TensorFlow to generate images resembling some great artworks
 
Built and trained a generator model to create images from random noise and a discriminator model to distinguish between real and generated images.
 
Employed Binary Cross-Entropy Loss and Adam optimizers to enhance model performance.
 
Implemented a training loop to alternately train the generator and discriminator over multiple epochs
